# RetractoBot

RetractoBot checks PubMed for retracted papers, finds all the papers that cite those retracted papers, and alerts the authors of those papers about the retractions.

We run it as an RCT: we send alerts for about 50% of all retracted papers, and we will check whether the citation rates of those papers changes.

More information can be found on our website [retracted.net](https://retracted.net) and in our study protocol on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Retractobot_-_Revised_Stage_1_Registered_Report_Protocol_Oct_2023_/24468391).
